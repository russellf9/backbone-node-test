# Backbone Node Test
A repo for a Coding Test using JS/Backbone

## Background
Originally a FED test by Red Ant


## Running the App

To run the app CD to the root location and run:

```
$ node server.js
```

Open a browser using: `http://127.0.0.1:1339/`


## Conclusion
I've used this more of an exercise to learn Backbone, as it's a new framework to me.

I certainly had fun doing the exercise at a leisurely pace, unfortunately I've run out of time to go further.

I've certainly learnt a lot and perhaps will re-visit Backbone and this test in the future.
